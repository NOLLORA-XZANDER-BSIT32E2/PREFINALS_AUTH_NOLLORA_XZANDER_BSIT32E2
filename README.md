Onion Architecture: (Yes/No)

Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?

Yes,
// I'm aware of it and its purpose, but I'm uncertain about how to implement it in code.
MVC Pattern: (Yes/No)

Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?

Yes,
// However, due to insufficient understanding of the programming language, I struggle to implement it.
Web API: (Yes/No)

Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?

No,
//
Application & Bottlenecks:
Onion Architecture:

Benefits: (1-3 keywords)

Decoupled
Consistent
Structured
Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)

Dividing functions across different layers allows the architecture to follow a systematic and methodical approach to providing outputs.
Isolation of modules enables a more comprehensive way to identify issues and weaknesses within the infrastructure, allowing for problem isolation without affecting the roles of other layers.
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)

Yes. I lacked understanding of what I was programming due to insufficient information. I ended up following various tutorials for different functions, which overlapped with other tasks I was attempting to accomplish. This resulted in a mix of different techniques stitched together.
MVC:

Components: (1-3 keywords each)

Model, View, Controller

Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.

Model: Manages the data, logic, and rules of the application's domain.
View: Responsible for presenting data to the user.
Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)

Yes, my primary issue is a lack of understanding of the structure to effectively connect them.
Web API:

Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.

I'm not entirely clear on the key difference because I'm not familiar with the traditional structure and performance of MVC applications. However, I understand that Web APIs are designed to handle HTTP requests and responses, focusing on providing data without the need for a user interface, unlike traditional MVC applications that are geared towards rendering views for the user.


Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)

The main problem I experienced was installing all the project's dependencies. 
With Web API dependencies, I have no experience debugging these issues, so I tried lowering the version to ensure compatibility.
